abstract: <p>Most of the motor mapping procedures using navigated transcranial magnetic
  stimulation (nTMS) follow the conventional somatotopic organization of the primary
  motor cortex (M1) by assessing the representation of a particular target muscle,
  disregarding the possible coactivation of synergistic muscles. In turn, multiple
  reports describe a functional organization of the M1 with an overlapping among motor
  representations acting together to execute movements. In this context, the overlap
  degree among cortical representations of synergistic hand and forearm muscles remains
  an open question. This study aimed to evaluate the muscle coactivation and representation
  overlapping common to the grasping movement and its dependence on the stimulation
  parameters. The nTMS motor maps were obtained from one carpal muscle and two intrinsic
  hand muscles during rest. We quantified the overlapping motor maps in size (area
  and volume overlap degree) and topography (similarity and centroid Euclidean distance)
  parameters. We demonstrated that these muscle representations are highly overlapped
  and similar in shape. The overlap degrees involving the forearm muscle were significantly
  higher than only among the intrinsic hand muscles. Moreover, the stimulation intensity
  had a stronger effect on the size compared to the topography parameters. Our study
  contributes to a more detailed cortical motor representation towards a synergistic,
  functional arrangement of M1. Understanding the muscle group coactivation may provide
  more accurate motor maps when delineating the eloquent brain tissue during pre-surgical
  planning.</p>
