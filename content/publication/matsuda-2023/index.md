abstract: Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a valuable tool for
  non-invasive brain stimulation. Currently, nTMS requires fixing of markers on the
  patient’s head. Head marker displacements lead to changes in coil placement and
  brain stimulation inaccuracy. A markerless neuronavigation method is needed to increase
  the reliability of nTMS and simplify the nTMS protocol. In this study, we introduce
  and release MarLe, a Python markerless head tracker neuronavigation software for
  TMS. This novel software uses computer-vision techniques combined with low-cost
  cameras to estimate the head pose for neuronavigation. A coregistration algorithm,
  based on a closed-form solution, was designed to track the patient’s head and the
  TMS coil referenced to the individual’s brain image. We show that MarLe can estimate
  head pose based on real-time video processing. An intuitive pipeline was developed
  to connect the MarLe and nTMS neuronavigation software. MarLe achieved acceptable
  accuracy and stability in a mockup nTMS experiment. MarLe allows real-time tracking
  of the patient’s head without any markers. The combination of face detection and
  a coregistration algorithm can overcome nTMS head marker displacement concerns.
  MarLe can improve reliability, simplify, and reduce the protocol time of brain intervention
  techniques such as nTMS.
