abstract: 'This study is the first step in an effort to develop three-dimensional
  (3D) printing for use in pediatric surgical planning. In order to accomplish this,
  we established an effective collaboration between Ribeirao Preto Clinics Hospital
  (HCRP) and Renato Archer Center for Information Technology (CTI). Printed biomodels
  can be used to support discussions, decision-making, and neuronavigation before
  surgery. The main purpose of 3D printing for specific case handling is to reduce
  damage by enhancing knowledge of orientation during surgical planning and personnel
  training before surgery. Here, we produced an object that represented the brain
  and face segment of a patient via additive manufacturing technology based on magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specific landmarks were measured by three distinct
  methods: manual caliper, an InVesalius software measurement tool, and neuronavigation
  coordinate detection. The mean coefficient of variation was 7.17% between all methods
  and landmarks measured. Our results validate the combined use of biomodels with
  InVesalius software tools for the assessment of individual brain anatomy facilitating
  manual handling and visualization of 3D models. The establishment of communication
  protocols between the teams involved, as well as navigation protocols for quality
  control, presents the possibility of developing long term training programs, and
  promotes the congregation of individuals from research areas in Medical Physics,
  Medical Sciences, and Neuroscience.'
