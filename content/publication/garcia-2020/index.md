abstract: 'Objective: There seems to be no consensus in the literature regarding the
  protocol of surface electromyography (sEMG) electrode placement for recording motor
  evoked potentials (MEP) in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applications.
  Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the MEP amplitude bytwo
  different protocols for electrode placement. Methods: SEMG electrodes were placed
  on three upper arm muscles (biceps brachii, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor pollicis
  brevis) of six right-handed subjects following two different protocols (1 and 2),
  which varied according to the interelectrode distance and location relative to the
  muscle. TMS pulses were applied to the hotspot of biceps brachii, while sEMGwas
  recorded from the two protocols and for each muscle simultaneously. Main Results:
  Greater MEP amplitudes were obtained for Protocol 1 compared to Protocol 2 (P <
  0.05). Significance: Different electrode placement protocols may result in distinct
  MEP amplitudes, which should be taken into account when adjusting the intensity
  on single and repetitive TMS sessions.'
