abstract: "Background: Neuronavigation provides visual guidance of an instrument during
  procedures of neurological interventions, and has been shown to be a valuable tool
  for accurately positioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coils relative
  to an individual's anatomy. Despite the importance of neuronavigation, its high
  cost, low portability, and low availability of magnetic resonance imaging facilities
  limit its insertion in research and clinical environments. New method: We have developed
  and validated the InVesalius Navigator as the first free, open-source software for
  image-guided navigated TMS, compatible with multiple tracking devices. A point-based,
  co-registration algorithm and a guiding interface were designed for tracking any
  instrument (e.g. TMS coils) relative to an individual's anatomy. Results: Localization,
  precision errors, and repeatability were measured for two tracking devices during
  navigation in a phantom and in a simulated TMS study. Errors were measured in two
  commercial navigated TMS systems for comparison. Localization error was about 1.5
  mm, and repeatability was about 1 mm for translation and 1° for rotation angles,
  both within limits established in the literature. Comparison with existing methods:
  Existing TMS neuronavigation software programs are not compatible with multiple
  tracking devices, and do not provide an easy to implement platform for custom tools.
  Moreover, commercial alternatives are expensive with limited portability. Conclusions:
  InVesalius Navigator might contribute to improving spatial accuracy and the reliability
  of techniques for brain interventions by means of an intuitive graphical interface.
  Furthermore, the software can be easily integrated into existing neuroimaging tools,
  and customized for novel applications such as multi-locus and/or controllable-pulse
  TMS."
