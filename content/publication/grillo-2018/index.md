abstract: "Background: Training in medical education depends on the availability of
  standardized materials that can reliably mimic the human anatomy and physiology.
  One alternative to using cadavers or animal bodies is to employ phantoms or mimicking
  devices. Styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) gels are biologically inert and
  present tunable properties, including mechanical properties that resemble the soft
  tissue. Therefore, SEBS is an alternative to develop a patient-specific phantom,
  that provides real visual and morphological experience during simulation-based neurosurgical
  training. Results: A 3D model was reconstructed and printed based on patient-specific
  magnetic resonance images. The fused deposition of polyactic acid (PLA) filament
  and selective laser sintering of polyamid were used for 3D printing. Silicone and
  SEBS materials were employed to mimic soft tissues. A neuronavigation protocol was
  performed on the 3D-printed models scaled to three different sizes, 100%, 50%, and
  25% of the original dimensions. A neurosurgery team (17 individuals) evaluated the
  phantom realism as \\\"very good\\\" and \\\"perfect\\\" in 49% and 31% of the cases,
  respectively, and rated phantom utility as \\\"very good\\\" and \\\"perfect\\\"\
  \ in 61% and 32% of the cases, respectively. Models in original size (100%) and
  scaled to 50% provided a quantitative and realistic visual analysis of the patient's
  cortical anatomy without distortion. However, reduction to one quarter of the original
  size (25%) hindered visualization of surface details and identification of anatomical
  landmarks."
