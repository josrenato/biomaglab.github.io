abstract: The investigation of magnetic nanoparticles for medical and biological applications
  is relatively recent and steadily growing. When properly functionalized, magnetic
  nanoparticles (MNPs) can target cancer cells and deliver a drug or heat to these
  cells. MNPs are being investigated in several applications in medicine such as hyperthermia,
  magnetic particle imaging, cell separation and magnetofection, in vitro and in vivo
  alternating current biosusceptibility, T1 and T2 magnetic resonance contrast agents,
  and magnetorelaxometry. In each of these applications, a specific physical property
  is measured. Magnetorelaxometry relies on the fact that when MNPs are magnetized
  they can relax by the Brownian and Néel mechanisms. Both mechanisms depend on the
  MNP size and for certain conditions can have a faster relaxation through the Brownian,
  compared to the Néel, mechanism. This can be exploited to target cells. For certain
  sizes, when an MNP is free to rotate in the biological fluids, they will relax faster
  than when attached to a cell. This can provide a high contrast for detection of
  magnetically-labelled cancer cells, making it possible to differentiate normal from
  cancer tissue. Until very recently SQUIDs were the main detectors employed to measure
  MNPs, but Optically Pumped Magnetometers (OPM) are now an attractive alternative.
  OPMs are smaller, do not need liquid helium, and are simpler to operate than SQUIDs.
  Here, we present the initial steps of the development of an OPM-based instrument
  to measure relaxation of MNP in vitro.
